d 'FRE': module to display one-way frequency table
d 
d   fre displays, for each specified variable, a univariate
d frequency table containing counts, percent, and cumulative
d percent. Variables may be string or numeric. Labels, in full
d length, and values are printed. By default, fre only tabulates
d the smallest and largest 10 values (along with all missing
d values), but this can be changed. Furthermore,  values with zero
d observed frequency may be included in the  tables. The default
d for fre is to display the frequency  tables in the results
d window. Alternatively, the tables may be written to a file on
d disk, either tab-delimited or  LaTeX-formatted.

d 'SDECODE': module to decode a numeric variable into a string variable
d 
d  sdecode (super decode) creates an output string variable with
d values from the input numeric variable varname, using labels if
d present and formats otherwise. The output string variable may
d either replace the input numeric variable or be generated as a
d new variable named newvar. Unlike decode, sdecode creates an
d output string variable containing the values of the input
d variable as output by the list command and other Stata output,
d instead of decoding all unlabelled input values to missing.
d sdecode is especially useful if a numeric variable has value
d labels for some values but not for others. msdecode is a
d multivariate version of sdecode, which inputs     a list of
d numeric variables and (optionally) a list of delimiters,     and
d creates a single string variable, containing the concatenated and
d     decoded values of all the input variables, separated by the
d   delimiters if provided.

d 'SENCODE': module to encode a string variable non-alphanumerically into a numeric variable
d 
d  sencode is a sequential version of encode. It takes, as input, a
d string      variable, and generates, as output, a numeric
d variable, with value labels    corresponding to values of the
d string variable. Unlike encode, sencode      orders the numeric
d values corresponding to string values in the sequential
d order of appearance in the input string variable in the data set,
d or in      another order specified by the user, instead of
d ordering them in alphanumeric      order of the string value, as
d encode does. The mapping from numeric code   values to string
d labels may be one-to-one (coded in order of first  appearance
d of the string value) or many-to-one (coded in each observation
d   by the position of that observation in the data set, or in the
d user-specified      ordering).

d 'OUTREG2': module to arrange regression outputs into an illustrative table
d 
d  outreg2 provides a fast and easy way to produce an illustrative
d table  of regression outputs. The regression outputs are produced
d piecemeal and are  difficult to compare without some type of
d rearrangement. outreg2  automates this process by concatenating
d the successive regression outputs in a  vertical format. The
d resulting table is saved to the disk in ASCII  format, which can
d be read by other programs. outreg2 thus facilitates  the
d convertion of regression outputs to a standard format suitable
d for  inclusion in a scholarly publication. The functionality of
d outreg2 is based on the earlier package outreg,  by John Luke
d Gallup. Unlike outreg, outreg2 is capable of writing LaTeX-format
d tables, as well as ASCII, MS Word and MS Excel.

d 'RECLINK': module to probabilistically match records
d 
d Record linkage involves attempting match records from two
d different data files that do not share a unique and reliable key
d field. It can be a tedious and challenging task when working with
d multiple administrative databases where one wants to match
d subjects using names, addresses and other identifiers that may
d have spelling and formatting variations. Formal record linkage
d methods often employ a combination of approximate string
d comparators and probabilistic matching algorithms to identify the
d best matches and assess their reliability. Some stand-alone
d software is available for this task. This presentation will
d introduce -reclink-, a rudimentary probabilistic record matching
d program for Stata. -reclink- employs a modified bigram string
d comparator and allows user-specified match and non-match weights.
d The algorithm also provides for blocking (both "or" and "and") to
d help improve speed for this otherwise slow procedure.
